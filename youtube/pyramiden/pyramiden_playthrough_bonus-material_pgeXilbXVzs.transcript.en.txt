ROGER HOLZBERG:
The most exciting thing about the product is working on a game where the
point of the game is not about killing people or shooting down planes or
blowing up boats.
It's about learning of what existed in a time before we lived and
learning a psyche of a people that we don't know anymore.
It's about visiting a place that's almost alien to us and having to
use the people and the tools in that place to solve problems

VERNA HARVEY:
Hi, I'm Verna Harvey and I'm the line producer on Pyramid.
I don't think even Piccadilly Circus in the rush hour with all
of the lights malfunctioning will quite come up to the logistical
nightmare Pyramid has been in keeping it on schedule and keeping
track of all the files.
Those include 18 000 animation files, 1 700 art files,
1 600 dialogue files and 500 sound effects and music elements.
That's without the code.
How do we do it?
Well, we've amassed a terrific group of people - talented,
hard-working, and committed - and you feed them well.
Not like the ancient Egyptians. I don't think spring onions,
bread, and ale quite make it.
You also have to distract them sometimes from the fact that
they've only had four hours of sleep the night before.
Anyway, it's been a lot of fun, we've really had a good time
with this and we hope you have a good time playing with it.

00:01:44,210 --> 00:02:06,460
ALBERT REINHARDT:
My favorite part of working on this project has got to be
the mix of all these different medias.
Not only are we working with sound and text on a computer
but we're also dealing with a special effects house which
is one of the first times this is happening in the
multimedia industry.

ARI SCHINDLER:
I'm Ari Schindler, I'm the technical director for
the Pyramid project.
Questions that might come to mind and I might have an answer
to would be what it took to ship this product and what sort
of Planning Organization we used.
The approach that we decided to take was roughly equivalent
to what the Egyptians decided to take in building a pyramid in
that we used vast amounts of labor vast amounts of time and
little or no forethought in terms of who was going to get hurt
along the way.
With respect to the experience of the people involved we started
out with six months of experience on my part and basically no
experience on anybody else's part in the technical staff.
That comes to two and a half weeks of average experience per
member of our crew.

SEAN JONES:
Hi, I'm Sean Jones, I'm character designer
and lead animator for Pyramid.
I think the most interesting challenge in the pyramid project
was getting that perfect balance between Egyptian
stylization and regular cartoon stylization.
I looked at a lot of Egyptian art and especially a lot of
hieroglyphs and modeled after the extreme hieroglyphic stylization
which is >???<[1] torso and an extreme profile on all characters
except for Gods and royalty which can look you in the eye.

[1]: What word is being said?
    frontal...something?
    prominent?

6
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:57,590
My name is Pam Spertus. I'm the art director and lead artist
on pyramid.
Here's how we created the background screens.
We try to make our background screens look very similar to
the Dream Quest sets.
As each level was completed at dreamquest Albert, David, and I
went over to Dream Quest and took slides of all the backgrounds
that we knew we would need according to our design document.
We crawled around on our hands and knees, had to wear special little
chrome shoes as to not ruin the set and we had to be certain that
what we were going to do is going to be right because we were only
going to have one shot at it.
Then we would take those slides, put them on a photo CD, composite
them together and, using Photoshop primarily, we went in and we
painted them trying to get them a little less looking like a model,
adding a little bit of our own touch to it but at the same time
making sure that it worked with what we had received from Dream Quest
and what you would see in virtual flight.

00:05:44,670 --> 00:06:32,120
RANDY HALE:
I came up with the instrumentation for the pyramid music by doing
some research on traditional Middle Eastern sounds and attempting
to recreate them with my synthesizers here in the studio.
Also, you know, trying to provide more orchestral ambient effects
and sounds along with those instruments.
The real challenge has been to try and find sounds in the actual
computer that can sound like that.
Most important thing I hope the music will bring to the product
is an emotional through-line from beginning to end.
Also hopefully having the ability to entertain, to hold the user
and provide an ambience of the period.

8
00:06:38,889 --> 00:07:03,030
And action!
Tusk carvings, delicate luck charms from a beast that shook the
ground when it walked.
Like I love that, all right that's a keeper.
Let's do it one more time just a little bit looser.

9
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:25,600
What a world!
What a world!
Where a little builder like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness.
I will get you in the next world master builder!

10
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:55,470
You let the capstone fall off the side?
You let the capstone fall off the side?!
I've worked my entire life for this moment.
I hope the foreman can find the stone carvers in time to make another
capstone.
They were on their way home last time I heard.

11
00:07:49,770 --> 00:08:04,350
Do just the pickup on that one and action!
I did not believe that a human of your heart walked the earth.

12
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:25,820
Four… Three… Two…
Woah yay yeah duuh yeah wa-ho woah we-hey wa aaah.
[Laughs]

13
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Ooh
[Gulping sounds]
[Sounds of disgust]
[Wheezing, laughs]

14
00:08:46,940 --> 00:09:12,430
[Loud snoring]
[Laughing]
Oh it's fun being in audio, isn't it?

15
00:09:26,550 --> 00:10:29,790
Let us find the north.
The north.
I will help you at the wall.
Let us find the north.
[Burp]
That would be totally cool.
We should have different zooms on the four different people.
Yes, exactly.
It should flash between all of us.
Hello little chap.

00:11:47,900 --> 00:12:37,010
DAVID GOLDBERG:
I've always been fascinated by the mystery and grandeur of the
pyramids in ancient Egypt and to get a chance to do that in
miniature in a way that we can actually sort of get our hands on it
is very interesting.
It's also a lot of fun, you kind of feel when you're building these
things that you're doing something that somebody else did 4 500 years
ago.
On the overall table I think we had something like 50 or 60 each of
several different kinds of tents as well as about 45 or 50 individual
buildings and maybe 300 palm trees.
To finish off the landscape on the table we covered the entire
landscape with about three tons of sand that was then dressed in
around the pyramid all the little structures.
Nothing looks like sand except sand.

17
00:12:38,180 --> 00:13:05,660
MIKE SHEA:
The most difficult technical element of this project was to interface
the Dream Quest motion control system with the different various
techniques that we're using to grab the frames for displaying on the
CD-ROM.
So there's a lot of things that we're learning now that we haven't
had to in the past.
We're applying everything we do know about making feature films in
television movies but the technical aspects are actually quite
different.

18
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:18,730
DAVID MCCULLOUGH:
I feel really good about the collaboration between dream quest and
knowledge adventure.
I feel that we're working as a team, not as two separate companies.
Everybody's been really wonderful and we're all trying to solve
the same problems together.

19
00:13:32,410 --> 00:14:02,560
CHERYL WEINER:
When I first saw Pyramid it took my breath away.
I knew we wanted to publish it.
What could be more fun for kids than building a pyramid, and in the
process they would learn about ancient egypt: its culture, its people,
and its technology.
Education was the goal, entertainment was the way to get there.
The McGraw-Hill Home Interactive team was convinced that we could
make Pyramid into a product that would stand the test of time and
lead to other exciting products.

20
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:46,460
PHILIP BOUCHARD:
As producer for McGraw-Hill, I focused on making sure that this
great product design lived up to its full potential.
We focused on several key questions:
    Are the goals of the game clear?
    Are the puzzles the right difficulty?
    Does a dialogue make sense?
    Are there plenty of clues available?
    Are there lots of fascinating educational tidbits to discover?
    And most important: Do the players enjoy the experience?
When we could say "definitely yes" to all these questions then we
knew that the game was ready.

21
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:29,600
STEVE WHITE:
In quality assurance we test the program by looking at the program
code and by testing it for hours on end.
Our major concern is looking at whether the program actually runs,
and then our secondary and only a slightly lower
level is: Is this entertaining? Is this interesting? Is this going
to hold someone's attention? Are they going to want to play this?
The bottom line was, Pyramid was a lot of fun for all of us.
We had a lot of fun playing with it, and the kids we had, they just
ate it up and they couldn't wait to come back the next time.
