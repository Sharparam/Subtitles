ROGER HOLZBERG:
The most exciting thing about the product is working on a game where the
point of the game is not about killing people or shooting down planes or
blowing up boats.
It's about learning of what existed in a time before we lived and
learning a psyche of a people that we don't know anymore.
It's about visiting a place that's almost alien to us and having to
use the people and the tools in that place to solve problems

VERNA HARVEY:
Hi, I'm Verna Harvey and I'm the line producer on Pyramid.
I don't think even Piccadilly Circus in the rush hour with all
of the lights malfunctioning will quite come up to the logistical
nightmare Pyramid has been in keeping it on schedule and keeping
track of all the files.
Those include 18 000 animation files, 1 700 art files,
1 600 dialogue files and 500 sound effects and music elements.
That's without the code.
How do we do it?
Well, we've amassed a terrific group of people - talented,
hard-working, and committed - and you feed them well.
Not like the ancient Egyptians. I don't think spring onions,
bread, and ale quite make it.
You also have to distract them sometimes from the fact that
they've only had four hours of sleep the night before.
Anyway, it's been a lot of fun, we've really had a good time
with this and we hope you have a good time playing with it.

00:01:44,210 --> 00:02:06,460
ALBERT REINHARDT:
My favorite part of working on this project has got to be
the mix of all these different medias.
Not only are we working with sound and text on a computer
but we're also dealing with a special effects house which
is one of the first times this is happening in the
multimedia industry.

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:57,879
ARI SCHINDLER:
I'm Ari Schindler, I'm the technical director for
the Pyramid project.
Questions that might come to mind and I might have an answer
to would be what it took to ship this product and what sort
of Planning Organization we used.
The approach that we decided to take was roughly equivalent
to what the Egyptians decided to take in building a pyramid in
that we used vast amounts of labor vast amounts of time and
little or no forethought in terms of who was going to get hurt
along the way.
With respect to the experience of the people involved we started
out with six months of experience on my part and basically no
experience on anybody else's part in the technical staff.
That comes to two and a half weeks of average experience per
member of our crew.

5
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,069
hi I'm Shaun Jones I'm character

65
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,989
designer and lead animator for pyramid I

66
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,879
think the most interesting challenge in

67
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,829
the pyramid project was getting that

68
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,799
perfect balance between Egyptian

69
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:20,650
stylization and regular cartoon style

70
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,290
ization I looked at a lot of Egyptian

71
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,689
art and especially a lot of hieroglyphs

72
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,720
and modeled after the extreme

73
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:32,230
hieroglyphic stylization which is from

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,980
torso and an extreme profile on all

75
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,879
characters except for God's and royalty

76
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,879
which can look you and I

77
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,310
you

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,140
my name is Pam Curtis I'm the art

79
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,840
director made artist on pyramid here's

80
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,030
how we created the background screens we

81
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,620
try to make our background screens looks

82
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,630
very similar to the dream quest sets as

83
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,880
each level was completed at moonquest

84
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,660
Albert David and I went over to dream

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,579
quest and took slides of all the

86
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,650
backgrounds that we knew he would need

87
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,090
according to our design document we

88
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,040
crawled around on our hands and knees

89
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,550
had to wear special little chrome shoes

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,410
as to not ruin the set and we had to be

91
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,580
certain that what we were going to do is

92
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,240
going to be right because we were only

93
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,960
going to have one shot at then we would

94
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,700
take those slides with amount photo CD

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,850
composite them together in using

96
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,530
Photoshop primarily we went in and we

97
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,710
painted them trying to get them a little

98
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,140
less looking like a model adding a

99
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,300
little bit of room touch to it but at

100
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,370
the same time making sure that it worked

101
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,290
with what we had received from dream

102
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,590
quest and what you would see in virtual

103
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,590
quite

104
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,669
you

105
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,440
you

106
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,100
Oh

107
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:51,030
I came up with the instrumentation for

108
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,230
the pyramid music by doing some research

109
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,660
on traditional Middle Eastern sounds and

110
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,870
attempting to recreate them with my

111
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,140
synthesizers here in the studio also you

112
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,480
know trying to provide more orchestral

113
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,610
ambient effects and sounds along with

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,490
those instruments the real challenge has

115
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,550
been to try and find sounds in the

116
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,130
actual computer that can sound like that

117
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,460
most important thing I hope the music

118
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,410
will bring to the product is an

119
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,010
emotional through line from beginning to

120
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:28,710
end also hopefully having the ability to

121
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,120
entertain to hold the user and provide

122
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,120
an ambience of the period

123
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,949
you

124
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:51,040
and action metal implant does garbage

125
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:55,810
delicate what charms from a beast that

126
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,760
shook the ground we need watch like I

127
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,980
love the advocate all right that's a

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,030
keeper let's do it one more time just a

129
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,030
little bit looser

130
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:15,850
what a world Wow we're a little builder

131
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:20,270
like you could destroy my beautiful

132
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:25,600
wickedness I will get you in the next

133
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,600
world master builder

134
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,550
you let the caps don't pull off the side

135
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:36,540
you let that taps don't fall off the

136
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:40,170
side I've worked my entire life for this

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,810
moment I hope the foreman can find the

138
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,870
stone carvers in time to make another

139
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,770
capstone they were on their way home

140
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:55,470
last time I heard do just to pick up on

141
00:07:49,770 --> 00:08:00,350
that one and action I do not believe

142
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,350
that a human of your heart

143
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:25,820
4320 day yeah yeah yeah

144
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Oh

145

you

147
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,339
let us find the north

148
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:43,420
from or I will help you at the wall let

149
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,420
us fine

150
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:55,519
but right now into medium or asleep

151
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:07,779
hi I'm have been holiday mellow yes a

152
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:16,589
digging around I can eat some I top shot

153
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:18,610
70 yeah she's your war totally cool I

154
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,260
should be cool should have different

155
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,970
assumes on the four different it's keep

156
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,970
this is that the flash between all of us

157
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,790
edited camp

158
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,760
you

159
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,029
the first anything

160
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,150
Oh

161
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,260
you

162
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:34,149
we forgot the first anything to be

163
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:39,060
repeatable and Ed a legend in whatever

164
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:39,060
you must be consistent food

165
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,779
you

166
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,530
I've always been fascinated by the

167
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,180
mystery and and grandeur of the pyramids

168
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,550
in ancient Egypt and to get a chance to

169
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,350
do that in miniature in a way that we

170
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,320
can actually sort of get our hands on it

171
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,030
is is very interesting it's also a lot

172
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,770
of fun you kind of feel when you're

173
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,160
building these things that you're doing

174
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,770
something that somebody else did 4,500

175
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,650
years ago on the overall table I think

176
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,780
we had something like 50 or 60 each of

177
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,720
several different kinds of tents as well

178
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,830
as about 45 or 50 individual buildings

179
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,110
and maybe 300 palm trees to finish off

180
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,820
the landscape on the table we covered

181
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,190
the entire landscape with about three

182
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,630
tons of sand that was then dressed in

183
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,180
around the pyramid all the little

184
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:40,010
structures nothing looks like sand

185
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:42,050
accepts and the most difficult technical

186
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,030
element of this project was to interface

187
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,060
the dream quest motion control system

188
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,920
with the different various techniques

189
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,680
that we're using to grab the frames for

190
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,970
displaying on the cd-rom so there's a

191
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,610
lot of things that we're learning now

192
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,410
that we haven't had to in the past we're

193
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,030
applying everything we do know about

194
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,520
making feature films in television

195
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,430
movies but the technical aspects are

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,660
actually quite different I feel really

197
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,790
good about the collaboration between

198
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,670
dream quest and knowledge adventure I

199
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:14,000
feel that we're working as a team not as

200
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,590
two separate companies everybody's been

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,730
really wonderful and we're all trying to

202
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,730
solve the same problems together

203
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,280
you

204
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,010
when I first saw a pyramid it took my

205
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,410
breath away I knew we wanted to publish

206
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,510
it what could be more fun for kids than

207
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,060
building a pyramid and in the process

208
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,410
they would learn about ancient egypt its

209
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:50,930
culture its people and its technology

210
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,340
education was the goal entertainment was

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,770
the way to get there the mcgraw-hill

212
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,810
Home Interactive team was convinced that

213
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,400
we could make pyramid into a product

214
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,560
that would stand the test of time and

215
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,560
lead to other exciting products

216
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,010
you

217
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:15,660
as producer for mcgraw-hill

218
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,540
making sure that this great product

219
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,180
design lived up to its full potential we

220
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,970
focus on several key questions are the

221
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,520
goals of the game clear are the puzzles

222
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,740
the right difficulty does a dialogue

223
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,590
make sense are there plenty of clues

224
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,800
available are there lots of fascinating

225
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:37,230
educational tidbits to discover and most

226
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,080
important to the players enjoy the

227
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,230
experience when we could say definitely

228
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,460
yes to all these questions then we knew

229
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,460
that the game was ready

230
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,269
you

231
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,420
in quality assurance we test the program

232
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,640
by looking at the program code and by
