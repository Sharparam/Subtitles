00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,074
<i>- A ship comes stocked with...
- With what? </i>

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,800
- With... Ties of blood!
- Okay.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,110
- Then I have to send something starting with D.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,318
- A ship comes stocked...
- With what?

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,351
With disco!

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,739
No, you have to stock it with
important things.

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,449
What?

8
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:55,856
If you have a big ship to stock, you
want important things in it.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,021
You don't stock it with disco!
Try again.

10
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:12,562
- Umm... A ship comes stocked then.
- Okay, with what?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
With you.

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,000
EVERYTHING IS POETRY BABY

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,500
<i>Lina, I'm on the bus now.</i>

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,959
<i>I don't really know why I'm writing.
I don't know what to say.</i>

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,680
<i>I think of you sometimes... a lot.</i>

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,485
<i>There's a man in front of me who
smells of sweat.</i>

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,000
<i>Remember when I was drunk and puked
all over your shoe?</i>

18
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,564
<i>I apologised but you just laughed and
said "Everything is poetry baby".</i>

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,497
<i>I bet you would call the sweaty man
poetry as well.</i>

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,977
<i>I just think he's gross.</i>

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,200
<i>I wish I didn't.</i>

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,000
<i>I was thinking about the
bus stop earlier.</i>

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I always walk barefoot.

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,740
I know I wear shoes.

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,500
But inside of them I'm barefoot.

26
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,414
I know you, what's your name?

27
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:07,737
- Elmin.
- Elmin... Lina.

28
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:32,215
Elmin and Lina...

29
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,800
<i>It's weird how we've been living here
all this time...</i>

30
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,900
<i>Shopped at the same store,
sat on the same bus.</i>

31
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,521
<i>But never known each other.</i>

32
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,199
<i>There are so many people we don't know.
Even though you live next to them.</i>

33
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,522
<i>I think I understand now,
that thing you said...</i>

34
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,461
Do you do this a lot?

35
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,518
Sometimes, when Albin isn't home.
If I feel like it.

36
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,500
- It's fun to create, don't you think?
- Sure.

37
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,000
I built a lot of LEGO when I was little.

38
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,279
Kind of foolish to stop when you
grow older.

39
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,420
For a while I was really building
a lot.

40
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:55,056
- A LEGO pro, huh?
- Yeah... "LEGO pro".

41
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,436
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know, a castle?

42
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,528
- Or apartments that these can live in.
- And then?

43
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,747
- A train station maybe?
- I mean later.

44
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
<i>In life.</i>

45
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,217
Oh.

46
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,667
- Well, I don't know.
- Difference.

47
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,801
That's what I want to do.

48
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,143
How do you mean?

49
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,023
I don't know, just a difference.

50
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,053
For me, and others.

51
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:48,438
There are so many people we never meet.
We should take care of those we do.

52
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,300
And make a difference for each other.

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,291
But I don't know... Do you?

54
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,086
I'm cold, tea?
